# Structures- Assignment

1. Create a C program that would read the academic record of 5 students. After the record of all the students
have been entered, the user should be provided with a menu which has the following:
  * Enter ‘1’ to display the names of all the students
  * Enter ‘2’ to find the average mark of all the students in Maths
  * Enter ‘3’ to search for a particular student based on the roll number


Each record should contain the following:
  * Name of the student
  * Roll no
  * Mark in Maths
  * Mark in Sanskrit
  * Mark in Programming
The code to display the name of all the students, finding the average and to search should be within three
separate functions (one function to display the name of all students, one function for finding the average,
likewise one function to search for a student based on a roll number)
