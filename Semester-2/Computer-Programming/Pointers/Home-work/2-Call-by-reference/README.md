# Call By Reference

1. Create a function to return sum, difference and product of two numbers passed to it.

2. Write a loop that uses a pointer reference as the loop counter. In other words, convert the
variable x to a pointer reference in the below code so that it works exactly the same :
```
int x;
for (x= 1; x < 5; x++)
	printf(“loop counter value is %d \n“,x);
```
