The major difference in VLA and Dynamic memory allocation is:
--> VLA is usually performed on stck,whereas DMA is on heap.
--> VLA has ficed size once its size is allocated ,while DMA can resized.
--> VLA is allocated when the enclosing function is called whereas DMA  is allocated memory dynamically, at runtime and the returned memory has a lifetime which extends from the allocation until the deallocation.
--> In VLA allocated memory will be automatically managed whereas in DMA memory should be free().
