# CS

CS or more broadly, Computer Science.


Here, we collaborate and provide a possible method or solution to the assignments and labsheets assigned to us. 

## Semester 2

In Semester 2, we have uploaded our solutions for the given assignments.
Note that these solutions are not the only method to solve; there are other methods too.


They simply act as references.
