# 2D-Array-Task-1

1. Write a function to transpose a matrix
2. Given a matrix compute the maximum row sum ( sum of each row) of the matrix.
3. Calculate the sum and the maximum element of the antidiagonal (diagonal starting from top right to bottom left) of a given matrix
4. Given a matrix convert it to upper triangular and compute the sum of elements of the matrix. Check whether the computed sum is greater than or equal to 100 or not. If so print YES else print NO.
